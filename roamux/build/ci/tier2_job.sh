# two declared, restored channels: (1) the overlay symlink (flipped to this job's checkout, restored
# by the EXIT trap), (2) the pristine-reconcile + idempotent fail-loud patch runhook (roam-175: the
# base's tracked state is CI-owned). No sudo; no secrets on this tier.

# Channel 2 precondition (roam-175, roam-160 postmortem): reconcile the base's tracked
# state to pristine. The runhook's stack simulator matches the tree only against
# prefixes of THIS checkout's stack — after a patch-rewriting/deleting PR the base
# still carries the PREVIOUS stack, which matches no prefix and fails the job in
# seconds. reset --hard, not `checkout -- .` (that restores from a possibly-staged
# index); clean drops files a superseded stack ADDED, sparing the overlay symlink
# (-e /roamux, untracked by design) and all ignored paths (no -x: out/CI and the
# warm caches live there); single -f never descends into nested git repos (the
# DEPS-managed submodules). Consequence, documented in docs/ci/self-hosted-runner.md:
# the base's tracked state is CI-owned — uncommitted local edits do not survive a run.
