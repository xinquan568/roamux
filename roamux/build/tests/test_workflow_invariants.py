"""Hermetic CI-workflow invariants (roam-5, plan §12.6) — no Chromium checkout, no external deps.

These encode the tier-1 + release posture structurally, so every future workflow edit is gated:
  1. No workflow uses `pull_request_target` (the fork-secrets foot-gun).
  2. ci.yml has the stable `lint` job and it references no secrets (fork/tier-1 boundary is
     structural: fork isolation is GitHub's platform guarantee, preserved by structure).
  3. Chromium-dependent jobs are explicitly marked (ROAMUX_CHROMIUM_DEPENDENT) and gated: in ci.yml
     on BOTH the capability variable AND the non-fork condition (R15 — fork PRs stay tier-1 even
     after a capable runner exists); in nightly.yml on the capability variable.
  4. release.yml binds `environment: release` and triggers only on v* tags / manual dispatch.
  5. nightly.yml is scheduled.
  6. release.yml resolves machine-specific paths from the runner machine-env file contract
     (~/roamux-runner/.env: ROAMUX_CHROMIUM_SRC / ROAMUX_DEPOT_TOOLS) — the file is required and
     sourced unconditionally, every value is validated fail-loud, and no workspace-relative
     Chromium path may appear (roam-108).
  7. release.yml declares an explicit, generous job timeout — without one, GitHub's default 6h cap
     applies (self-hosted runners included) and a cold universal2 build is service-cancelled
     mid-compile (roam-110; run 29195822447 died at exactly 6h00m).
