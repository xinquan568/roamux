"""Hermetic CI-workflow invariants (roam-5, plan §12.6) — no Chromium checkout, no external deps.

These encode the tier-1 + release posture structurally, so every future workflow edit is gated:
  1. No workflow uses `pull_request_target` (the fork-secrets foot-gun).
  2. ci.yml has the stable `lint` job and it references no secrets (fork/tier-1 boundary is
     structural: fork isolation is GitHub's platform guarantee, preserved by structure).
  3. Chromium-dependent jobs are explicitly marked (ROAMUX_CHROMIUM_DEPENDENT) and gated: in ci.yml
     on BOTH the capability variable AND the non-fork condition (R15 — fork PRs stay tier-1 even
     after a capable runner exists); in nightly.yml on the capability variable.
  4. release.yml binds `environment: release` and triggers only on v* tags / manual dispatch.
  5. nightly.yml is scheduled.
  6. release.yml resolves machine-specific paths from the runner machine-env file contract
     (~/roamux-runner/.env: ROAMUX_CHROMIUM_SRC / ROAMUX_DEPOT_TOOLS) — the file is required and
     sourced unconditionally, every value is validated fail-loud, and no workspace-relative
     Chromium path may appear (roam-108).
  7. release.yml declares an explicit, generous job timeout — without one, GitHub's default 6h cap
     applies (self-hosted runners included) and a cold universal2 build is service-cancelled
     mid-compile (roam-110; run 29195822447 died at exactly 6h00m).
  8. release.yml creates the universal out dir (out/Release) before invoking Chromium's
     universalizer — the upstream script os.mkdir()s its output bundle and requires the parent to
     exist; a fresh builder has neither (roam-112; run 29214000668 died post-compile).
  9. release.yml passes GN args by import(), never newline-flattened — a tr-flattened commented
     args file is ONE line whose first '#' comments out every arg, so slices silently build pure
     GN defaults (wrong arch, debug, component, no Sparkle); and it canary-checks the args took
     effect after gn gen plus asserts each slice's arch after compile (roam-114; run 29218872385).
  10. release.yml gates the assembled bundle's dyld resolution — every @rpath dependency of the
      framework must resolve via its own LC_RPATHs to a file inside the bundle (roam-121; the
      v0.0.1-alpha.1 install aborted at first launch on an unresolvable Sparkle rpath).
  11. release.yml stamps the tag-derived version into the renamed bundle (rename_bundle
      --bundle-version from GITHUB_REF_NAME) so the installed CFBundleVersion and the appcast
      sparkle:version share one comparable scheme (roam-120; Chromium's 7827.x otherwise outranks
      every tag version and Sparkle never offers an update).  12. release.yml's publish leg is re-cut-safe — any prior release for the tag is deleted before
      drafting, the fresh draft is tracked by id, and publish PATCHes that id (never edit-by-tag,
      which republished the stale release while the fixed draft stayed invisible; roam-124,
      run 29261520357).  13. ci.yml's Conventional-Commits check enumerates PR commits with --no-merges — GitHub's
      "Update branch" button injects a merge commit whose subject is not Conventional, and the
      check's contract is each AUTHORED commit, never platform merges (roam-134).
